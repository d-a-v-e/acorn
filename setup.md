### Setting up Mac OS X for development with Git

Clone this repo and add ./bin to your $PATH. Run

    -v > results/your_name.yaml

using your own name there. See the GitHub help pages for more details! Then try

    git status
    git add .
    git commit -m "my first git commit"

Now it's time to get serious. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), as explained there. Then in OS X Terminal:

    brew install git

Then download [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download/).

Then write up the rest of the process here and commit it all to Git!
